# Introduction

# 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

# 

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
The entire team was split into two smaller groups. Each report was tested using each of the various models by one team while the other team tested each report using the various Applicability Analysis techniques. Upon completion of both tests, each team conveyed the whole idea to the other team, and all team members then assessed one another's understanding to ensure that everyone had understood each and every concept. We spoke about how to present the time-between-failure, failure intensity, and reliability graphs, as well as which report to use for trends and what range of meaningful data to utilise. Additionally, we collaborated to talk about the acceptable range of failure rates for the test results.
