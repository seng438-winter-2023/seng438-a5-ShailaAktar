# Introduction

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

First of all to determine the MMTFmin we used the formula : MTTF = Total time(in hours)/Number of failures. Referencing failure report-3 we got the following results: total time= 11353 seconds = 3.1536 hours and 24 failures, therefore the MTTFmin is equal to 0.1314.Through the mentioned formula supported by the given data we calculated the MMTF min. Therefore MTTF min is 0.1314 hours/failure.

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
The entire team was split into two smaller groups. Each report was tested using each of the various models by one team while the other team tested each report using the various Applicability Analysis techniques. Upon completion of both tests, each team conveyed the whole idea to the other team, and all team members then assessed one another's understanding to ensure that everyone had understood each and every concept. We spoke about how to present the time-between-failure, failure intensity, and reliability graphs, as well as which report to use for trends and what range of meaningful data to utilise. Additionally, we collaborated to talk about the acceptable range of failure rates for the test results.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
Setting up the project and choosing the range of usable data using Laplace and other tests was the major hurdle.
# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
This lab was intriguing and difficult at the same time. The straightforward instructions and images made it easier to grasp. That provided us with practical reliability testing experience.
